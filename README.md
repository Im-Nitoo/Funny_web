# Future Scanner 🔮 

The Future Scanner is an interactive, funny web experience where users choose whether they want to see their “future”. Based on their choice, the website triggers animations, scanning effects, and the person gets the surprise based on their choices.

## 🚀 Features
## ✅ Interactive Popup

The website begins with a popup asking:
“Wanna see your future with AI?”

## Two options:

Yes → Start scanning process

No → Gets a surprise

## ✋ Fingerprint Scanner (9 seconds)

Scans the finger of the person.

A scanning bar moves up and down.

A blinking “Scanning your Fingers…” text creates a amaing effect.

After 9 seconds, the “future reveals”.

## 🎥 Outcomes

YES : Future prediction after scanning

NO : User gets a surprise
